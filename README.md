# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the classification of diabetes using a dataset with 520 rows and 16 predictor columns. The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual has diabetes (class 1) or not (class 0) based on various features. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to gain insights into the dataset. 
# Model Building
The dataset was split into training and test sets.
Multiple machine learning algorithms were used and the models were evaluated based on their F1 score.
# Model Selection
The Random Forest model yielded the highest F1 score, making it the best-fit model for predicting diabetes.
The F1 score was chosen because it considers both precision and recall, which are critical for a medical issue like diabetes.
